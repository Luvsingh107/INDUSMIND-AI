# INDUSMIND AI

An industrial AI assistant that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search and an interactive dashboard to help engineers interact with industrial documentation through natural language.

The platform ingests equipment manuals, operating procedures and maintenance documents, extracts structured knowledge, stores semantic embeddings in ChromaDB and enables intelligent question answering using Large Language Models.

---

## Overview

INDUSMIND AI was built to simplify the way engineers access technical knowledge.

Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages of equipment documentation, users can upload industrial manuals and interact with them using natural language. The system retrieves relevant information using semantic search and generates context-aware responses through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

The platform also provides a modern dashboard for monitoring the knowledge base, uploaded documents and system status.
